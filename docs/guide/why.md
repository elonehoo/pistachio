# Why Pistachio?

:::tip NOTE
Pistachio is a collection of utility functions based on [Composition API](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/composition-api-faq.html). We assume you are already familiar with the basic ideas of [Composition API](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/composition-api-faq.html) before you continue.
:::

Many friends will say that [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/) and Pistachio are very similar. What should I choose? Of course, we will use [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/) first, unless you need to use some specific APIs in Pistachio to consider Pistachio.

## Inspiration

This library is inspired by [@LinusBorg](https://github.com/LinusBorg) work and [composition-api-demos](https://github.com/LinusBorg/composition-api-demos) also other similar projects.
